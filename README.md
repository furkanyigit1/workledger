- **Syntax highlighting** -- 24 languages with Shiki, theme-aware code blocks
- **Wiki-style linking** -- Type `[[` to link between entries and build a knowledge graph
- **Backlinks** -- "Referenced by" panel below each entry shows all entries that link to it, auto-maintained on save
- **Entry templates** -- Start entries with structured sections: Decision Log, Debugging Session, Meeting Notes, Learning Log — each with pre-filled headings and auto-tags
- **Entry signifiers** -- Label entries as Note, Decision, Task, Question, or Idea with color-coded indicators; filterable in the sidebar

### Stay in control

- **Local-first** -- All data stored in IndexedDB, no server required
- **Optional server sync** -- End-to-end encrypted sync across devices. Use the default server or [self-host your own](https://github.com/gruberb/workledger-sync) — generate a sync ID, and your entries are encrypted before leaving the browser
- **Import & export** -- Export all entries as JSON for backup, import them back anytime
- **Archive & restore** -- Archive old entries to keep your workspace clean, browse and restore them anytime
- **Mobile-friendly** -- Responsive layout with touch-friendly controls
- **Keyboard-driven** -- `Cmd+J` new entry, `Cmd+K` search, `Cmd+\` toggle sidebar, `Escape` clear filter

### Optional: AI Notebook Companion

An optional AI sidebar with 12 concrete engineer actions. Off by default, zero impact on the core app when disabled. Easy to remove if unwanted — fork and delete `src/features/ai/` without affecting anything else.

**Quick start:**

1. Click the **gear icon** in the left sidebar and select **Enable AI**
2. **Configure a provider** — choose one:
   - **Ollama (local):** Install [Ollama](https://ollama.com/), run `ollama pull mistral`, done
   - **Hugging Face (remote):** Paste a free [API token](https://huggingface.co/settings/tokens) and pick a model
   - **Custom server:** Point to any OpenAI-compatible endpoint
3. Hover over a note and click the **lightbulb icon**
4. **Pick an action** from 4 categories:

| Category | Actions |
|----------|---------|
| **Summarize** | My Day, My Week, A Topic |
| **Generate** | Standup Update, PR Description, ADR from Notes, Draft Message |
| **Think** | Rubber Duck, Challenge My Thinking, Explore Tradeoffs |
| **Remember** | What Did I Decide About...?, When Did I Last Work On...? |

Actions support multi-entry context (day, week, or topic scope) and topic search.
